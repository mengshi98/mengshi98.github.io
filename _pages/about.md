About
======
I am currently a postgraduate student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, specializing in **dispatch algorithms for mining fleets**. My research focuses on optimal and intelligent decision-making for transportation systems. I have a year of experience as a data engineer at Tonghuashun, an online stock trading platform. Proficient in Spark, Hive, and Hadoop, I also founded Cognimatrix.co, a company that introduces LLM agents to the gaming industry.

Research
======
My research aims to build and understand AI systems that are scalable, robust, and human-like, particularly in the transportation sector. I believe that integrating Model Predictive Control (MPC) and World Models is the pathway to the next paradigm, as current large language models (LLMs) and crude end-to-end autonomous driving solutions will not be the final paradigms.

My philosophy incorporates several key elements:
1) My research places equal emphasis on theoretical foundations and empirical validation.
2) My research aims to diverge from current mainstream paradigms, not chasing trends but focusing on solid, foundational research.
3) My work is committed to the spirit of open-source sharing, favoring transparency and collaboration over isolation.
